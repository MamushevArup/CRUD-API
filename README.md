# CRUD-API

This is CRUD-api for book-management systems.
In this project we can Get all books/by id, Create book, Update book, Delete all book/by id.
The data is sending in json format.
For storing data I use postgres and for checking I use Postman.
To connect to the database I use GORM and for routing I use gorilla/mux
I try to stick to Golang file structure cmd/main pkg/config pkg/utils pkg/controllers pkg/models pkg/routes.
Technologies which was used : Golang, Postgres, Git, Gorm, Gorilla/mux, Postman.
